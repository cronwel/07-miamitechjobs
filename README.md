# README 07-miamitechjobs

Start Date-8/9/17 End Date-8/9/17

**Purpose:** To practice Ruby on Rails skills and maintain knowledge.

**Methods:** This was an on-line tutorial available through Youtube.

**Ref:** Child, M. "How to Build a Jobs Board In Rails 4".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=814gCeOpM4o&list=PL23ZvcdS3XPLNdRYB_QyomQsShx59tpc-&index=7. October 18, 2014.

**Results:** Good tutorial overall. The main gems used are as follows:
* simple_form-form creation
* haml- replacement for ERB style of Ruby syntax coding
* bootstrap-sass- basic CSS styling

**Blocks:** nay, this was a quick tutorial, first one I've completed in a single day.


**Lessons:** Reinforcement of basic concepts, this is definitely keeping me in the groove of understanding how everything works. I may revisit this later just to add users with devise.
